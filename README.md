# PZ-Config-bomber
## proposed use: 
Place this config in the directory of your project zomboid server and have it run with the start up script.
When you upload a text file, it will read the file, match the keys and change the values in the config.

##todo

add a script to restart the server for changes to take affect.

Create a front end with a python backend to generate the txt file removing the need to ssh into the server.
